        The current system allows users to post their listings and view other's. The system provides users with recommendation of the 
        items they are viewing. The recommendation system uses images but more data types will be included, such as text to improve the 
        recommendation accuracy.

      <div class="hashtag"> Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Python, Pytorch, matplotlib</div>

      <p>
        CEOT-DRL is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) package developed during my stay in the Centro de Electrónica, Optoelectronica e Telecomunicações (CEOT) research center: https://www.ceot.ualg.pt/ for DRL research on networking and systems. CEOT-DRL is designed such that it abstracts almost everything. 
        Therefore, regardless of which computational graph platform is used to define the neural nets, it can still run smoothly.
      </p>

      Inspired by the Matlab Reinforcement Learning Toolbox, CEOT-DRL decomposes the learning task into scenario, environment, model, and a training manager.
      This design allows us to focus on the problem to develop the required scenario and let the training manager does the whole end to end training and testing.
      
      
      The following example shows how to solve the CartePole-v1 problem using an Actor-Critic model trained by the training manager. 
      The source code is available here: <a class="button" href="https://github.com/fmstam/MLS"> source code</a>

    <li><b>Sheba: a lightweight image processing library</b><br>
      <div class="hashtag"> Java, NetBeans Platform, Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML)</div>
      <!-- <img src="images/p-trap.png" alt="P-TRAP" class="left" style="width: 80%"/>       -->
  
      <p>A free open source lightweight image (and signal) processing package which is designed ground-up based on the best practices found in some existed packages like imagej and cellprofiler.
      It is designed to act as a container of components like channel, plugin, filter, and pipeline. It basically creates pipelines and executes them, which is helpful for fast prototyping, or developing a lightweight core module of an application that requires image processing.
      The main features of Sheba is its high modulation, and simplicity to create image processing pipelines.
      In Sheba the input and output are channels. An image, for instance, can contain multiple channels and can be processed by filters. To realize image processing pipelines,
      Sheba arranges them in a sequence of filters (i.e. a pipeline). For instance, if the task is to segment an image. This can be done by creating a pipeline that starts by a Gaussian filter (smoothing plugin), followed by a grayscale filter (conversion plugin), followed by a segmentation filter (segmentation plugin).
      </p>

      The following example shows how to calculate a polynomial illumination field from a grayscale image.
      Sheba's full source code can be found here:
      <a class="button" href="https://github.com/fmstam/SHEBA/tree/master/Sheba/src">source code</a>
      
      
      <pre class="prettyprint">

      // build a pipeline to estimate the illumination surface of an image using a 2-D polynomial of polynomialDegree degree 
      Pipeline pipeline = new Pipeline();
      pipeline.addTask(new Scale(downSamplingFactor)); // scale down
      pipeline.addTask(new IlluminationSurface(IlluminationSurface.SurfaceType.Polynomial, polynomialDegree)); // estimate the illumination field
      pipeline.addTask(new Scale((1 / downSamplingFactor))); // scale up back    
      outputImage = imageFilter.run(inputImage, pipeline); // apply the pipeline on the image.
      </pre>
    Moreover, Sheba allows adding compiled plugins (.jar files) without changing the code or modifying the pipelines. That is adding or updating functionalities on the fly. 
    This can be helpful when a team works on the pipeline where plugins can be tested locally and deployed to the final system.

      <a class="button" href="articles/P-TRAP_manual.pdf">See the user manual</a> <br>
      
      <p>A free open source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture and seed-related traits. 
        The software is written in Java and can be used with different platforms (the user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses Netbeans Platform 7.3). The application offers three main tools: a tool for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a tool for the analysis of seed shape. The three tools can be used independently or simultaneously for analysis of the same image. Results are then reported in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Values (CSV) file formats. Images of rice panicles were used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the software. Compared to data obtained by manual processing, P-TRAP produced reliable results in a much shorter time. In addition, manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are vulnerable to damage. 
        The software is very useful, practical and collects much more data than human operators. It has been used in many centers around the world and despite being old (developed in 2013) and with little maintenance and upgrade, it still one of the top and most used systems in panicle image analysis. 
        There are more powerful and precise new systems that use the state-of-art image processing libs and more sophisticated algorithms but P-Trap is platform-independent, user-centered, and easy to use with fantastic GUI.

      <p>A free and open source software with a user friendly interface written all in Java on top of NetBeans Platform to perform spa typing, detecting new repeats and new spa types and synchronizing automatically the files with the open access database. The installation is easy and the application is platform independent. In fact, the SPA identification is a formal regular expression matching problem and the results are 100% exact. As the program is using Java embedded modules written over string manipulation of well established algorithms, the exactitude of the solution is perfectly established.        </p>

      <p> A new effective descriptor for microfilaria. Since microfilaria is a thin elastic object, the proposed descriptor handles it locally. At each medial point of the microfilaria, the local structure of the microfilaria votes for a given shape. Accumulating these votes in the polar domain yields a rich descriptor.  </p>

      <p> A retrospective algorithm for correcting the uneven illumination field in microscopy images. The illumination field is iteratively made uniform using an increasing sequence of bivariate polynomials. At each iteration, the least squares problem of fitting a 2-D polynomial to a sampled image is solved by using QR decomposition with column pivoting, where image samples are obtained by dynamic programming or watershed transform. This incremental scheme allows the smoothness constraint of the estimated bias field to be implicitly satisfied. The proper number of iterations is determined by an automatic stopping criterion.
        This algorithm is similar to the Gradient Boosting with stopping criterion where the R-squared is used to determine the deterioration in the correction boosting.
