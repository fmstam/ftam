      <p>A free open source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture and seed-related traits. 
        The software is written in Java and can be used with different platforms (the user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses Netbeans Platform 7.3). The application offers three main tools: a tool for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a tool for the analysis of seed shape. The three tools can be used independently or simultaneously for analysis of the same image. Results are then reported in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Values (CSV) file formats. Images of rice panicles were used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the software. Compared to data obtained by manual processing, P-TRAP produced reliable results in a much shorter time. In addition, manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are vulnerable to damage. 
        The software is very useful, practical and collects much more data than human operators. It has been used in many research center and despite being developed in 2013 it still one of the top systems in panicle image analysis.

      <p>A free and open source software with a user friendly interface written all in Java on top of NetBeans Platform to perform spa typing, detecting new repeats and new spa types and synchronizing automatically the files with the open access database. The installation is easy and the application is platform independent. In fact, the SPA identification is a formal regular expression matching problem and the results are 100% exact. As the program is using Java embedded modules written over string manipulation of well established algorithms, the exactitude of the solution is perfectly established.        </p>

      <p> Protein identification using Mass Spectrometry (MS) is essential in the study of proteomics and one of the most popular methods for protein identification using MS data. This project provides a free computational tool for protein identification using PMF data. It introduces a new scoring method to help in identifying the correct protein. </p>

      <p> A new effective descriptor for microfilaria. Since microfilaria is a thin elastic object, the proposed descriptor handles it locally. At each medial point of the microfilaria, the local structure of the microfilaria votes for a given shape. Accumulating these votes in the polar domain yields a rich descriptor.  </p>

      <p> A retrospective algorithm for correcting the uneven illumination field in microscopy images. The illumination field is iteratively made uniform using an increasing sequence of bivariate polynomials. At each iteration, the least squares problem of fitting a 2-D polynomial to a sampled image is solved by using QR decomposition with column pivoting, where image samples are obtained by dynamic programming or watershed transform. This incremental scheme allows the smoothness constraint of the estimated bias field to be implicitly satisfied. The proper number of iterations is determined by an automatic stopping criterion.
        This algorithm is similar to the Gradient Boosting with stopping criterion where the R-squared is used to determine the deterioration in the correction boosting.
